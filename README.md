# Code & Conquer

A React Web Application using Vite and TypeScript

Teaches Data Structures and Algorithms to prepare for Job Interviews and Dominate LeetCode

This web application is in line with SDG 4 : Quality Education

The goal of this project is to help others learn better data structures and algorithms in one website where they won't need to use other sites for them to try on IDEs of their choice. This will also give activities while helping others learn the topics of DSA.
